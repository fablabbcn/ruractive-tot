    In this task, repeat the process by focusing on a local challenge in your rural community. Think about reallife issues that elderly people, youth, or women face due to the digital divide. Identify a specific problem, brainstorm how digital technologies and rapid prototyping could help, and develop a simple prototype using 2D or 3D tools.
