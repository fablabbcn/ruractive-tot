# Day three:

Barduino sticker contest!

Today we want to test your graphic design skills... 

1. Design a Barduino sticker (it can be related to Adventronics or just the Barduino)
2. Upload your design to the Telegram group
3. Vote for your favourite designs adding a reaction to the message (you can vote for 3 proposals)
5. The poll will be open until Wednesday 6 of December.
4. On Thursday we will announce the winner and all the participants will have one!

[Here](../../files/BarduinoSVG.zip) you can find some SVG's of the Barduino.

Good luck!

<sup>We reserve the right to reject a proposal if we consider it not appropiate.</sup>
