# What it a Digital Learning Kit (DLK)

The Digital Learning Kit is a curated collection of resources, tools, and platforms designed to support the Local Community Trainers (LCTs) in their learning journey. It serves as an interactive hub where the LCT community can access knowledge, develop skills, create content, and share experiences.

This kit brings together educational materials, digital platforms, and collaborative spaces that help LCTs navigate the digital transition, engage with their communities, and foster knowledge exchange. By interacting with these resources, LCTs learn, experiment, and co-create, strengthening their role as facilitators of local development.
